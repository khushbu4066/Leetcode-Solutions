In this problem we need to find the minimum number of buses needed to travel from the source to the target using the given bus routes. The key insight is to use a BFS (Breadth-First Search) approach to explore the possible routes.

**Steps**:
1. Create a mapping of stops to the routes that pass through them.
2. Use BFS to traverse the bus routes, starting from the source stop.
3. Keep track of visited stops and visited routes to avoid redundant exploration.
4. Continue the BFS until reaching the target stop, and return the number of buses taken.
Complexity

**Time complexity**:
Let N be the total number of stops and M be the total number of bus routes. The time complexity is O(N + M), where N accounts for building the stop-to-route mapping, and M represents the BFS traversal. In the worst case, each stop and route are processed once.

**Space complexity**:
The space complexity is O(N + M), where N is the space required for the stop-to-route mapping, and M is the space needed for the BFS queue, visited stops, and visited routes. In the worst case, all stops and routes are stored in the data structures.
