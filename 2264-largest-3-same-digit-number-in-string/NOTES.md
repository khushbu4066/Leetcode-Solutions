**Intuition**
The task is to find the maximum good integer in the given string, where a good integer is defined as a substring of length 3 consisting of only one unique digit.

**Approach**
Iterate Through Substrings:

Iterate through each substring of length 3 in the given string.
Check if the substring consists of only one unique digit (all three characters are equal).
If it meets the conditions, convert the substring to an integer and update the maximum.

**Return Result:**
If no good integer is found, return an empty string.
If the maximum good integer is 0, return "000" (considering leading zeroes).
Otherwise, return the maximum good integer as a string.â€‹
